\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

From the transport of dissolved nutrients through biological tissue to
the extraction of petroleum from underground deposits, there are
numerous systems in which it of interest to study the flow of multiple
fluids through porous media. In many useful cases, the physics of the
flow is characterised by coupled governing equations that are
nonlinear and transient, and the problem is further complicated by
material heterogeneity and irregular geometries.

The goal of this work is to devise and implement general numerical
algorithms for such systems. Our specific focus is on robustness
through adaptive error-control and normal-human-readable
implementation. multiphase flow through porous media, complete with
error control.
